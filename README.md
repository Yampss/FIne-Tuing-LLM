# FIne-Tuing-LLM
# SQL-Generation-LLM

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate SQL outputs from textual input. The fine-tuning process incorporates the use of `unsloth` to optimize GPU workload. The dataset for training is sourced from the Hugging Face datasets repository.
