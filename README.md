## Overview

The main components of this repository include:
- **Model Configuration:** Applying PEFT techniques to configure the model for efficient training.
- **Trainer Initialization:** Setting up the training process using `SFTTrainer`.
- **Tokenization:** Preparing input text for the model.
- **Text Generation:** Using the fine-tuned model to generate SQL query responses.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required Python packages using a package manager like `pip`. Ensure that you have Python and necessary libraries installed.

## Training

1. **Configure the Model:**
   Apply PEFT techniques to configure the model. This involves setting parameters such as the low-rank adaptation rank, target modules, and other hyperparameters for training and optimization.

2. **Initialize and Train the Model:**
   Use the `SFTTrainer` class to initialize the training process with the configured model, dataset, and tokenizer. Specify training arguments such as batch size, gradient accumulation steps, warmup steps, maximum training steps, and optimizer settings. Train the model with these configurations.

## Text Generation

1. **Tokenize Input Text:**
   Prepare the input text by tokenizing it and converting it to a suitable format for the model.

2. **Generate SQL Query:**
   Define the context and question for the SQL query. Use the text generation pipeline to generate a response based on the provided context and question. The pipeline utilizes the fine-tuned model to produce the desired SQL query.
